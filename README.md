Hello thank you for reviewing my assignment. 

To compile the program enter the following in terminal:

>make


To run the p2testscript, the standard method should work:

>p2testscript > mytestresults 2>&1 


If running the script doesn't work, please put a dot in front of command:
>./p2testscript > mytestresults 2>&1 

thank you.
